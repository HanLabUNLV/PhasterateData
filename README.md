#Phasterate Paper Data Compilation

##Description
This repo includes several scripts and all data: multiple
sequence alignments, trees, along with conservation scores and p-values.

##Folders
	
Scripts/
	This folder includes scripts to compute p-values from likelihood data and make
	volcano plots.

MakeGraph/
	This folder includes the tex file to create graphs described above. Notice
	LaTex is required as well as the TexShade package:
	https://www.ctan.org/pkg/texshade?lang=en

	Sample output and input data is included.

FittedData/
	Data from the paper used to fit F84 and F84e models, as well as fitted
	models, computed likelihoods, and p-values.

InnerNodeData/
	Data generated by running phyloP on several fake alignments to see what the
	probabilities at the inner nodes looked like.
