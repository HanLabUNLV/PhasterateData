% Creates a printout of the given alignment file in .fa format using the texshade package.
% This creates a "pretty" alignment graph. Additionally, this script expects a score file
% of phyloP scores to plot against every column in our alignment. This file should contain
% normalize P-Scores from -50.0 to 50.0 with a score as a floating point number at every
% line with the same number of scores as there are lines in the file.

% This script is used to plot conservation scores for gap envents visually alongside a DNA
% multiple sequence alignment, therefore the fasta file should have an "extra" specie as
% it's first specie containing no gaps. This specie will be used as the coordinate frame
% to make sure that the column numbers are correct.

% See attached files for example data.
